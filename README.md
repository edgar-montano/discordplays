# discordplays

Inspired by TwitchPlays, DiscordPlays simulates keyboard inputs and events. DiscordPlays attempts to emulate "crowdplay" by parsing commands sent by users through Discord's Chat API. The commands are parsed by a bot within the chat, that is also responsible for relaying the commands into the game.
